	<p class="inspire content" id="inspirecontent">Inspiration comes in many forms and sizes; the lightest of words could create the heaviest effects. The desire to create change, improve life, end suffering, and anything else far wide and in between, is all a consequence of experiecing or viewing the experience of a situation where a change would modify a situation for the better. Thus, a primary importance of inspiration is that exposure is unlimited, much further reaching than ignorance.</p>

The journey towards perfection is an infinite, often repeating similar actions or thoughts, but fulfilling path. Continuous self reflection and being open to criticism opens the path to self improvement, and therein exists the true meaning of enlightenment. <em>"I would rather practice one kick ten thousand times, than ten thousand kicks a single time."</em> </p>
